I'm a new postdoctor at Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University (https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning, computer vision, and computer graphics.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Liu (http://39.96.165.147/people/liujiaying.html) and join STRUCT Research Group (http://39.96.165.147/). My current research involves multimodal diffusion-based image-to-image translation and style transfer, art font creation, and diffusion-based 3D rendering.
